Project name: Agentic Hedge Fund

A Qwen Cloud Agent Society that runs a simulated hedge-fund trading desk.

Agentic Hedge Fund is a replay market simulation where specialized Qwen agents decompose a trading day, debate catalysts, route a basket through portfolio/risk/compliance/committee gates, execute simulated fills, and benchmark the agent society against a required single_agent baseline.

This is a simulation and education project only. It does not connect to a real brokerage, does not execute real trades, and does not provide investment advice.

Qwen Cloud Global AI Hackathon - Track 3: Agent Society.

Inspiration
I recently became a quant dev, which pushed me deeper into market microstructure, portfolio construction, execution logic, and the reality that trading decisions are rarely one-dimensional. At the same time, I have been getting more interested in AI agents and how far they can go beyond normal chat-style reasoning.

One thing that bothered me is that normal AI does not really trade properly. A single model can sound confident, but it usually does not behave like a real desk: it does not separate research from risk, it does not debate opposing views, it does not enforce compliance, it does not reason about order-book liquidity, and it often jumps straight from "bullish" to "buy" without the controls that a real trading system would need.

So I built Agentic Hedge Fund as an experiment: can a Qwen-powered agent society make better, safer, and more explainable simulated trading decisions than a normal single-agent AI trading setup? The project compares specialized agents against a single_agent baseline on the same replay so the extra complexity has to justify itself with measurable results.

What The Demo Shows
A dockable trading dashboard with market replay candles, order book, portfolio, and optional agent/governance panels.
An already simulated full-day replay named Example Full Day Simulation 11th June 2025 so reviewers can open a realistic saved run immediately after cloning.
Qwen agents evaluating up to 10 tickers as a portfolio slate.
Evidence-led allocation roles: primary catalyst, hedge candidate, relative-value candidate, and watchlist/hold reasons.
Simulated long/short marketable IOC fills through a deterministic order book and ledger.
Agent chat details with formatted structured JSON, tool calls, validation notes, and state transitions.
Replay keyframes for fast loading of full-day recordings.
Agent Society benchmark proof: multi_agent vs single_agent.
Requirements
Before running the project, install:

Git for cloning the repository.
Docker Desktop or Docker Engine.
Docker Compose v2, available as docker compose.
A Qwen Cloud DashScope API key for live Qwen agent runs.

The agents do not mutate financial state directly. They propose, debate, and explain actions; deterministic services own risk checks, compliance checks, broker routing, order-book matching, long/short accounting, replay persistence, and benchmark proof.

Quickstart
git clone https://github.com/Xuanming-Guo/Agentic-hedge-fund.git
cd .\Agentic-hedge-fund\
cp .env.example .env

# Put your API key in DASHSCOPE_API_KEY

docker compose up --build
Open:

Dashboard: http://localhost:5173
API health: http://localhost:8000/health
Qwen ping: http://localhost:8000/api/proof/qwen
MCP status: http://localhost:8000/api/mcp/status
On startup, the API waits for Postgres, runs Alembic migrations, seeds scenarios, and seeds the bundled replay fixture into SIMULATION_RECORDINGS_DIR if it is missing. Runtime-created recordings remain ignored by git.

If the dashboard opens but the scenario list or saved simulations are empty, the API probably did not finish startup and the seed step did not run. Check:

curl http://localhost:8000/health
docker compose logs api postgres
The API logs should show Database is reachable, Alembic migrations running, scenario seeding, and either the bundled replay being seeded or already present. Seeing a few Waiting for database lines is normal during startup; it is only a problem if it never reaches Database is reachable.

If Docker networking was stale, restart the stack:

docker compose down --remove-orphans
docker compose up --build
If you are testing two cloned copies on the same machine, give the clean clone a separate Compose project name so networks, containers, and volumes do not collide:

docker compose -p ahf-clean up --build
As a last resort after stopping this project and any other Compose projects you care about, prune unused Docker networks:

docker network prune
Qwen Cloud Setup
Set your Qwen Cloud DashScope key in .env:

DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_dashscope_key_here
QWEN_BASE_URL=https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
QWEN_MODEL_REASONING=qwen3.7-plus
QWEN_MODEL_FAST=qwen3.7-flash
QWEN_MODEL_CODER=qwen3-coder-plus
QWEN_JSON_MODE=true
QWEN_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_STRATEGY=json_object
QWEN_ENABLE_THINKING=false
MAX_QWEN_CALLS_PER_CYCLE=12
MAX_QWEN_TOOL_CALLS_PER_AGENT=6
MAX_PARALLEL_AGENT_CALLS=5
Provider resolution is intentionally simple for submission clarity:

If DASHSCOPE_API_KEY is present, the backend uses Qwen Cloud.
If no Qwen key is present, the backend uses deterministic mock agents for offline tests and demo resilience.
Alibaba Cloud evidence in this repository is the deployment path and proof checklist: infra/alibaba/, docker-compose.yml, and docs/ALIBABA_CLOUD_PROOF.md.

Bundled Replay
The curated replay is:

Example Full Day Simulation 11th June 2025
Fixture location:

apps/api/app/recording_fixtures/example-full-day-simulation-2025-06-11/
The large frame file is committed as compressed chunks:

frames.ndjson.gz.part001
frames.ndjson.gz.part002
At API startup, app.scripts.seed reconstructs the runtime frames.ndjson sidecar inside SIMULATION_RECORDINGS_DIR. This keeps the GitHub repository focused on one curated replay while leaving user-generated recordings ignored:

recordings/
apps/api/recordings/
To demo it:

Start the app with Docker.
Open the dashboard.
Open Simulations.
Select Example Full Day Simulation 11th June 2025.
Replay using action/keyframes for fast loading.
Run the benchmark panel to show multi_agent vs single_agent, or use the benchmark already saved in the final replay snapshot.
Agent Society Flow
CoordinatorAgent assigns the portfolio slate and tasks.
MacroAnalystAgent, TechnicalAnalystAgent, and SentimentNewsAnalystAgent review point-in-time context.
BullResearcherAgent and BearResearcherAgent debate catalyst quality and downside risk.
ResearchManagerAgent computes consensus, disagreement, and candidate ranking.
PortfolioManagerAgent proposes up to three evidence-led trades: primary, hedge, or relative value.
RiskManagerAgent resizes or rejects proposals using exposure, volatility, depth, and per-name limits.
ComplianceOfficerAgent blocks future-data leakage, irrelevant evidence, and restricted conditions.
InvestmentCommitteeChairAgent resolves disagreements and approves, resizes, defers, or rejects.
ExecutionTraderAgent routes simulated marketable IOC child orders into the deterministic exchange.
PortfolioLedger updates cash, positions, realized PnL, unrealized PnL, and exposure.
Benchmark
The Benchmark panel makes the Agent Society comparison explicit:

multi_agent vs single_agent
For the included full-day replay benchmark, the multi-agent society was scored across 516 replay keyframes against a single-agent baseline.

Latest replay benchmark result:

ASAI score: 25.11
Return delta: +0.24 pts
Risk avoided: 2 fewer risk violations
Metric multi_agent single_agent
Return 0.23% -0.00%
Max drawdown 0.65% 1.35%
Risk violations 0 2
Directional accuracy 78% 67%
Decision quality 100% 82%
The result I cared about was not only return. The agent society also showed lower drawdown, fewer risk violations, higher directional accuracy, and better decision quality on the replay benchmark.

POST /api/recordings/{recording_id}/benchmark
Live simulations can be benchmarked directly:

POST /api/simulations/{simulation_id}/benchmark
The benchmark compares the saved multi-agent outcome against a single-agent baseline and other deterministic baselines.

Actual Market Data
The launcher can import historical bars for manually entered stock tickers, then generate a deterministic replayable limit-order book from those bars. yfinance is the default no-key provider; Alpaca remains optional:

MARKET_DATA_MODE=synthetic
REAL_MARKET_TICKERS=AAPL,NVDA,MSFT,TSLA,AMD,AMZN,META,GOOGL,JPM,XOM
YFINANCE_INTERVAL=1m
YFINANCE_LOOKBACK_PERIOD=5d
ALPACA_API_KEY_ID=
ALPACA_API_SECRET_KEY=
ALPACA_DATA_FEED=iex
Older dates may use daily OHLCV as an anchor for deterministic intraday-shaped replay when 1-minute bars are unavailable. Order-book depth is simulated for replay consistency; it is not a live consolidated Level 2 feed.

Safety
Simulated trades only.
No real brokerage execution.
No investment advice.
Replays are redacted before being saved or served publicly.
Future-data leakage checks prevent agents from seeing unreleased events.
